# Compilation
- `$make [debug]` for a debug version with debugging information and assertions.
- `$make release` for a release version

# Usages
A [RoboCup Soccer 2D Simulator](https://sourceforge.net/projects/sserver/files/) (as well as a monitor and a logplayer) is needed to run WrightEagleBASE. Please refer to [https://wavepackage.wordpress.com/2013/06/07/how-to-install-the-robocup-soccer-server-2d/](https://wavepackage.wordpress.com/2013/06/07/how-to-install-the-robocup-soccer-server-2d/) and [https://wavepackage.wordpress.com/2015/07/22/how-to-install-robocup-2d-simulation-server-on-ubuntu-14-04/](https://wavepackage.wordpress.com/2015/07/22/how-to-install-robocup-2d-simulation-server-on-ubuntu-14-04/) for installation instructions.  

After installation,  

- Run `$rcssserver` to start a soccer server which simulates the game
- Run `$rcssmonitor` to start a soccer monitor which is used to display the game
- Run `$./start.sh` to start a team on the left side with default teamname *WEBase*
- Run `$./start.sh -t [TEAMNAME]` to start a team on the right side with teamname *[TEAMNAME]*

After both teams connected, send a `KickOff` command to the server by hitting `Ctrl+K` in the monitor to start the game!

# Hacks
- `void Player::Run` in `src/Player.cpp` is the main loop of the agent consisting of sensing, decision-making and executing
- `ActiveBehavior DecisionTree::Search` in `src/DecisionTree.cpp` is the main decision-making loop
- `void Behavior*::Plan` in `src/Behavior*.cpp` implement planning part of behaviours following a MAXQ task structure
- `void Behavior*::Execute` in `src/Behavior*.cpp` implement executing part of behaviours following a MAXQ task structure

A good start to hack the team is digging into `void Behavior*::Plan` functions. The [MAXQ-OP](http://aijunbai.github.io/publications/BWCtist15.pdf) task structure of the agent:
