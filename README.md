# wrighteaglebase
This is the release of WrightEagleBASE code, written in C++.

# Compiling
- `$make [debug]` for a debug version with debugging information and assertions.
- `$make release` for a release version

# Usages
A [RoboCup Soccer 2D Simulator](https://sourceforge.net/projects/sserver/files/) (as well as a minitor and a logplayer) is needed to run WrightEagleBASE. Please refer to [https://wavepackage.wordpress.com/2013/06/07/how-to-install-the-robocup-soccer-server-2d/](https://wavepackage.wordpress.com/2013/06/07/how-to-install-the-robocup-soccer-server-2d/) and [https://wavepackage.wordpress.com/2015/07/22/how-to-install-robocup-2d-simulation-server-on-ubuntu-14-04/](https://wavepackage.wordpress.com/2015/07/22/how-to-install-robocup-2d-simulation-server-on-ubuntu-14-04/) for installation instructions.  

After installation,  

- Run `$rcssserver` to start a soccer server which simulates the game
- Run `$rcssminitor` to start a soccer monitor which is used to display the game
- Run `$./start.sh` to start a team on the left side with default teamname *WEBase*
- Run `$./start.sh -t [TEAMNAME]` to start a team on the right side with teamname *[TEAMNAME]*

After both teams connected, send a `KickOff` command to the server by hitting `Ctrl+K` in the monitor to start the game!
